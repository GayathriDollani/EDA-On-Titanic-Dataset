**Exploratory Data Analysis on the Titanic Dataset**

This project performs a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the famous Titanic dataset from Kaggle. The goal is to uncover patterns and insights that help understand the factors affecting passenger survival.

## **Project Objectives**

    Understand the structure and content of the Titanic dataset.

    Clean and preprocess the data by handling missing values, outliers, and data types.

    Explore key features like age, gender, passenger class, fare, and embarkation point.

    Visualize distributions and relationships using graphs and charts.

    Identify patterns or correlations between features and survival rate.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

    Python

    Pandas for data manipulation

    NumPy for numerical operations

    Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization

    Jupyter Notebook for analysis

Key Insights:
- Females had a higher chance of survival compared to males.
- Passengers in 1st class had higher survival rates.
- Younger passengers, especially children, had better survival rates.
- Passengers traveling alone were less likely to survive.
- Ticket fare and family size showed some influence on survival.

📁 Dataset

The dataset used is the Titanic dataset provided by Kaggle, which includes:

    PassengerId, Name, Sex, Age, Pclass, Ticket, Fare, Cabin, Embarked, etc.

    Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
