## Project Objectives

    Understood the structure and content of the Titanic dataset.

    Cleaned and preprocessed the data by handling missing values, outliers, and data types.

    Explored key features like age, gender, passenger class, fare, and embarkation point.

    Visualized distributions and relationships using graphs and charts.

    Identified patterns or correlations between features and survival rate.

## Tools & Technologies Used

    Python

    Pandas for data manipulation

    NumPy for numerical operations

    Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization

    Jupyter Notebook for analysis

## Key Insights:
- Females had a higher chance of survival compared to males.
- Passengers in 1st class had higher survival rates.
- Younger passengers, especially children, had better survival rates.
- Passengers traveling alone were less likely to survive.
- Ticket fare and family size showed some influence on survival.



    Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
